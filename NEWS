
		CHANGES in `perm' VERSION 1.0-0.0

    o    fixed so permTREND gave no warnings: had if (alternative=="two.sidedAbs) which gave warning with default alternative vector.

    o    changed alternative="two.sidedAbs" to be called by alternative="two.sided"
         together with control=permControl(tsmethod="abs"). This is to avoid confusion
         with the coin package. The previous version alternative="two.sided" uses 
         tsmethod="central" in the control. Changed help to reflect those changes.

    o    fixed bug with tsmethod="abs" (previous version alternative="two.sidedAbs")
         in permTREND.
       
    o    fixed printout from permTREND so not too long names for data.name.
 
		CHANGES in `perm' VERSION 0.9-9.5

    o    fixed bug in calcPvals when wgts not equal to 1
         (i.e., when using network algorithm). This only
         effects the alternative="twosidedAbs" option.

    o    added more comments to R code
    
    o    changed twosample.pclt so it works with character variables for group
